## Instructions

To play the game, start by selecting any of the cards in the deck. Timer is started once the game loads. Once a card is open, the next step is to guess a matching card. The following may happen after taking a guess:

* If the 2 open cards match, they are marked mstch and remain open. The move counter is incremented.
* If the cards do not match, they are closed again. (Key is to remember the closed cards so that future guessing can be easier).Move counter is incremented.

Once all cards are matched, the timer stops, and the player is shown the score board along with the time taken. If player wishes to play again, board is reset.

Board can also be reset when the refresh button is clicked explicitly.

Star Rating: The game starts with the maximum star rating (3). It keeps decreasing as the player uses more moves to find the matching cards.
